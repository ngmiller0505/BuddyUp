//Pending Pods are for objects that show user what groups he has pending and add commitmentLength and FriendIDs to podApplication if it is a user accepting another user's friend group invite. They aren't used for anything on the backend. They can either be as type "friend" or type "community"
//if communityOrFriendGroup == "friend" : Pending pods are created for ALL INVITED friends ONLY. Pending Pod is not created for original group Creator (instead, regular is created for him). Friend Pending Pods are deleted from the front end when
