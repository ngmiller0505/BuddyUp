App is finished. What else needs to be done before launch?


1. Put on testflight
    0. Watch videos on putting things on testflight and sppstore to and add extra points to this list
        - if you change your version number testflight has to reaprrove your app. If you change your build number you can change
        - create app icons easily on skatch
        - archive app then set up external testers
    2. Questions about purchases
        1. will purchases transfer? CHECK
            1. if yes, include super purchase ($1 for a year for transfer purchases) CHECK WITH OFFER CODES
            2. if no, give everyone free access on the beta
    3. Determine beta participant list. ~30 people + who ever else wants. Inform them. teach them how to download testflight. Write good emil
    4. Mixpanel?? consumers will show you what they want, then tell you why they want it
    

2. Make coding changes
3. Put on AppStore
    -1. Terms and Condition
        1. questions about age restriction. tinder is 17+. I can probably get away with something similar. Maybe I have to verify 18+ in app?
